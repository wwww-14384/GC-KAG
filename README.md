Here is the official code and supplementary materials for the GC-AGL model:GC-AGL is a model designed for stock price prediction. 

It integrates Granger causality-based causal inference and enhanced graph representation learning to reduce spurious features and spurious correlations, respectively. image Our initial experiments were conducted within a complex business codebase developed based on Qlib. 
The original code is comprehensive, and we will release the dataset and core code in the future.
